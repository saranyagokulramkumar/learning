- handles complex constructors
- large number of parameters
- immutability
- handles the construction of objects and eliminates need for multiple overloaded constructors with different
 parameters as and when the required parameters increase in number (telescoping constructors)
- also eliminates the need for getters and setters to individually set each property of a class
- typically written with static inner class
- enforce contracts within builder inner class for required arguments
- immutable fields because no access to public setters, once the object is created using a builder it is final
