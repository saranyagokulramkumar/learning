- Singleton classes have a private instance of itself and a private constructor
- if not careful, singletons are not thread-safe
- difficult to unit test
- sometimes confused for factory - constructor should not need arguments, if it does it is not a singleton
- singleton returns the same instance every time, one constructor - no args, no interface
- whereas factory returns various instances, multiple constructors, interface driven
